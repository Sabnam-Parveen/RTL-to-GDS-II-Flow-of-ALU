# RTL-to-GDS-II-Flow-of-ALU

1. **Specification and RTL Design:**
   - Define the ALU functionality and write RTL code using a hardware description language (Verilog or VHDL).

2. **Functional Verification:**
   - Simulate the RTL code using Cadence Incisive or other simulation tools for functional verification.

3. **Synthesis:**
   - Use Cadence Genus for logic synthesis to convert RTL to a gate-level netlist.

4. **Floorplanning:**
   - Use Cadence Innovus or Encounter to perform floorplanning, specifying the core and periphery areas, power grid, and I/O locations.

5. **Placement:**
   - Cadence Innovus or Encounter can be used for placement to determine the location of each cell on the chip.

6. **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):**
   - Utilize Cadence Innovus or Encounter for clock tree synthesis to build an optimized clock distribution network.

7. **Routing:**
   - Cadence Innovus or Encounter tools can be employed for routing, connecting the placed cells with metal interconnects.

8. **Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS):**
   - Use Cadence Virtuoso to perform DRC and LVS checks on the layout to ensure it adheres to foundry rules and matches the schematic.

9. **Timing Analysis:**
   - Perform static timing analysis using Cadence Tempus or other tools to verify that the design meets timing requirements.

10. **Extraction:**
    - Use Cadence Quantus or other extraction tools to extract parasitic information and refine the timing analysis.

11. **Physical Verification:**
    - Run DRC and LVS checks again to ensure the final layout adheres to manufacturing rules.
